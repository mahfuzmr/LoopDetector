# Motifs Detection in Knowledge Graphs 

Our algorithms can count the loops in any given dataset that is in triplet format by 
1) Taking the triplet set as input.
2) Running several list comprehension, and comperison process
3) Determine the entity and the number of entitiy involved in any perticular shape. 
4) Determine the time complexity when more entity involved in any shape.
6) giving the shape and count as output.
