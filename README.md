# Motifs Detection in Knowledge Graphs 

Our algorithms can count the loops in any given dataset that is in triplet format by 
1) Taking the triplet set as input.
2) Running several list comprehension, and comparison process
3) Determine the entity and the number of entities involved in any particular shape. 
4) Determine the time complexity when more entity involved in any shape.
6) giving the shape and count as output. 

# Dataset AIDA
Repository contains dataset AIDA in different format(csv,nt,txt) that we used in our algorithm.
train,test and validation data is formatted as text. To use AIDA unzip 177743_W_A.zip. 177743_W_A.zip Contains train,test and validation.
